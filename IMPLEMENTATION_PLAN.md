# Specific Build Plan (3-Page Architecture)

## Phase 1 — Core Page Split (Completed)

- [x] `index.html` as dedicated Home page.
- [x] `how-it-works.html` as dedicated mechanics page.
- [x] `published-reports.html` as dedicated report feed page.
- [x] Top navigation uses full-page links only (no in-page hash routing).

## Phase 2 — Mechanics Communication (Completed)

- [x] Show 4-stage pipeline and role model.
- [x] Add prompt mechanics diagram and framing checklist.
- [x] Keep copyable full prompt block.
- [x] Keep persona cards visually prominent and easy to scan.

## Phase 3 — UX and Style (Completed)

- [x] Bright, upbeat color system.
- [x] Scroll-based reveal animations for educational sections.
- [x] Sticky side panel on the How It Works page.

## Phase 4 — Publishing Workflow (Next)

1. Add real report pages under `reports/`.
2. Add card metadata to `assets/data/reports.json`.
3. Keep report cards consistent with verdict counts and tags.

## Phase 5 — Ongoing Content Ops (Next)

1. Update persona descriptions as needed in `assets/data/persona_profiles.json`.
2. Keep raw prompt block up to date in `how-it-works.html`.
3. Validate Pages deployment after each merge.
